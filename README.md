# RAG Fusion
---
## Overview
RAG Fusion (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Fusion) is a powerful approach that enhances response quality by retrieving and synthesizing information from multiple sources. It combines advanced retrieval strategies with generative models to deliver more comprehensive and nuanced results.

## How RAG Fusion Works
- **Query Diversification:** Generates multiple variations of the user's query to expand the retrieval scope across diverse knowledge bases.
- **Information Fusion:** Combines results from multiple documents using techniques such as Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), Weighted Averaging, Ensemble Methods, or Simple Concatenation to generate a unified response.

## Why Use RAG Fusion?
- **Comprehensive Answers:** Fuses multiple perspectives for well-rounded responses.
- **Reduced Bias:** Minimizes reliance on single-document interpretations.
- **Reduced Ambiguity:** Resolves potential ambiguities by considering the entire document.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Broadens the information base for factually sound outputs.

## Implementation Steps

### **1. Environment Setup**
- Install necessary libraries, including `openai`.
- Configure the OpenAI API key to enable interaction with LLMs.

### **2. Generate Diverse Queries**
- Use an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) to create multiple variations of the original query for broader retrieval.

### **3. Perform Vector Search**
- Retrieve relevant documents for each query.

### **4. Apply Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**
- Aggregate results to prioritize documents that consistently rank high.

### **5. Generate the Final Output**
- Combine reranked results with generated queries for the final response

## Benefits of Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **Balancing Priorities:** Highlights documents relevant across multiple queries.
- **Enhanced Retrieval Quality:** Improves response accuracy and relevance.
