# RAG Fusion Implementation
RAG Fusion was introduced to address the limitations of traditional RAG systems. It extends RAG's capabilities by retrieving and fusing information from multiple documents, leading to more comprehensive and informative responses.

### **How RAG Fusion Works**
- **Query Diversification:** The system generates diverse queries from user input to retrieve information from multiple knowledge bases or perspectives.
- **Information Fusion:** Retrieved information is synthesized into a unified response using one or more fusion methods, enhancing the quality and reliability of the output.

## Fusion Approaches
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):** Combines ranked lists by calculating scores based on document positions across multiple queries.
- **Weighted Averaging:** Uses relevance scores to combine document embeddings or representations.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Merges results from different retrieval models or databases.
- **Simple Concatenation:** Concatenates retrieved documents for input to the LLM, though it may face context window limitations.

## Implementation Steps

### **1. Environment Setup**
- Install necessary libraries, including `openai`.
- Configure the OpenAI API key to enable interaction with LLMs.

### **2. Generate Diverse Queries**
- Use an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) to create multiple variations of the original query for broader retrieva.

### **3. Perform Vector Search**
- Retrieve relevant documents for each query.

### **4. Apply Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**
- Aggregate results to prioritize documents that consistently rank high.

### **5. Generate the Final Output**
- Combine reranked results with generated queries for the final response.

## Benefits of RAG Fusion
- **Comprehensive Responses:** Leverages multiple sources for nuanced and complete answers.
- **Reduced Bias:** Balances perspectives by relying on diverse documents.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Broadens information access for factually correct outputs.
