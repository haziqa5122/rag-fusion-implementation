# RAG Fusion Implementation
RAG Fusion was introduced to address the limitations of traditional RAG systems. It extends RAG's capabilities by retrieving and fusing information from multiple documents, leading to more comprehensive and informative responses.

### **How RAG Fusion Works**
- **Query Diversification:** The system generates diverse queries from user input to retrieve information from multiple knowledge bases or perspectives.
- **Information Fusion:** Retrieved information is synthesized into a unified response using one or more fusion methods, enhancing the quality and reliability of the output.

## Fusion Approaches
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):** Combines ranked lists by calculating scores based on document positions across multiple queries.
- **Weighted Averaging:** Uses relevance scores to combine document embeddings or representations.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Merges results from different retrieval models or databases.
- **Simple Concatenation:** Concatenates retrieved documents for input to the LLM, though it may face context window limitations.

## Benefits of RAG Fusion
- **Comprehensive Responses:** Leverages multiple sources for nuanced and complete answers.
- **Reduced Bias:** Balances perspectives by relying on diverse documents.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Broadens information access for factually correct outputs.
