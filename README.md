# Parent Document Retrieval (PDR) with LangChain
---
## Overview
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems excel at providing precise, fact-based responses by breaking down documents into smaller chunks for retrieval. However, this approach often sacrifices depth and coherence, especially for broad or complex queries.

**Parent Document Retrieval (PDR)** bridges this gap by implementing a two-tier retrieval system:
- **Chunk Retrieval:** elevant smaller "child" chunks are retrieved first.
- **Parent Document Retrieval:** Once relevant chunks are identified, their corresponding parent documents are retrieved to provide broader context.
---

## Benefits of PDR
- **Improved Coherence:** Enhances responses by leveraging full-document context.
- **Enhanced Understanding:** Broadens the knowledge base for better insights.
- **Reduced Ambiguity:** Resolves potential ambiguities by considering the entire document.
- **Ideal for Long-Form Content:** Ensures continuity and relevance in detailed responses.

## Implementation Steps

### **1. Environment Setup**
- Install necessary libraries, including `openai`, `langchain-community`, `chromadb` and `tiktoken`
- Configure the OpenAI API key to enable interaction with LLMs.

### **2. Load and Prepare Documents**
- Load documents from a website or directory.
- Define chunk sizes.

### **3. Create Vector Store and Retriever**
- Index child chunks and store parent documents.

### **4. Test the Retriever**
- Count Parent and Child Documents.
- Perform a Query

### **5. enerate Responses**
- Define a prompt template and generate responses using GPT.

## Applications of PDR
- **Customer Support:** Enhanced response accuracy for product-related queries.
- **Legal Research:** Retrieval of legal documents with broader context for clarity.
- **Academic Research:** Facilitating access to comprehensive research papers.
- **Content Generation:** Improved continuity and depth in AI-generated content.
